# K-means Clustering

## Introduction 
This project implemented K-means algorithm and applied to image segmentation and handwritten digits recognition. 

## General info
- Language: Python 
- Dataset: 
    - Image segmentation: custom images 
    - Handwritten digits recognition: MNIST dataset
    
## Repository's structure
- `main.py`: implementation of the algorithm. 
- `test.ipynb`: test the algorithm on the custom dataset and compare the result to Scikit-learn's benchmark. 
- `image_segmentation.ipynb`: applied the algorithm to segment RBG(A) images. 
- `mnist_classification.ipynb`: applied the algorithm to cluster and classify handwritten digits on MNIST dataset.
- `util.py`: helper functions. 
- `requirements.txt`: essential packages for the project. 
- `images`: result images achieved by using the algorithm to image segmentation and digits recognition. 
    
## Details
